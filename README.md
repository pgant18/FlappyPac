<h1>FLAPPY PAC </h1>

<h2>
This game is built off the origins of the game Flappy Bird but it has it's own twist. Instead of a bird you are playing as PACMAN trying to find his way home.

PACMAN grew wings and escaped the ghost. Now it is time for him to fly his way home but he has some pipes to get through in order to start his journey home. 
  
  In order to make PAC fly you have to hit any key on your keyboard then hit space to fly through the pipes.
  
  ENJOY!
